## Introduction

*Deep learning is fun. What not fun is the pipeline digging and rigging. Why can't we just enjoy the process
 of exploring all kinds of SOTA techniques with interesting dataset instead of wasting our coffee on boring things like implementing the sockets for it.*

**jai** is a LEGO-style PyTorch-based Deep Learning Library. 
The main idea behind **jai** is to reduce the amount of time spent on building all sort of pipelines or sockets to plugin those fancy deep learning tricks. This project also tend to create some handy toolkits for Kaggle.

## Dev. Plan

Implement anything popped up in my head when I got time and coffee...

## Installation

`pip install jai` (jai on PyPI is currently on a depreciated version)

## Library Walk Through 

Update soon
